# Wallet
---
Wallets are a term often confused with addresses.

A wallet is usually a piece of software (paper wallets exist too), that keeps track of account balances, key pairs, and can help create transactions.

Bitcoin is not actually stored in your wallet, just the private keys that give you access to your bitcoin.

This app that you are using can be considered a wallet. It stores addresses along with their balances. It helps you create transactions. And overall, it helps manage your bitcoin.

### Key Takeaway: Wallets do not hold your bitcoin and they are seperate from your addresses.
