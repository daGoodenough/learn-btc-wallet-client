## Addresses
A bitcoin address is the location that someone sends bitcoin to.

If you want to recieve bitcoin, you first need an address that you can give to people.

This address is related to your public and private key pair. As long as you are the only one that knows what your private key is, then you are the only one that can spend bitcoin spent to that address.

Addresses are [base85check encoded](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding), which means they are more readable and come with information about the key pair use to create that address.

##### To **get started** understanding what an address is, you will first need to *create a private and public key*.
