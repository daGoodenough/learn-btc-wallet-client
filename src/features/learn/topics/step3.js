### Step 3
Now that you have an address with a private key you can create your first transaction.\n
Before you do that you will need to get some bitcoin in your address.\n
Navigate to the address you just created and click "**Fund Address**".\n
Funding is not something you can do in a real wallet. You would normally need to buy or mine bitcoin. \n
Once you have some bitcoin sent to your address you can click "**Create Transaction**".\n
#### You can send bitcoin to the same address, or create another to send to.
