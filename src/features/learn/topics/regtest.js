const regtest = `## Regtest Mode
Bitcoin nodes are a program running on your computer, and they can be configured to run on different networks:\n
- **Mainnet** is where all the Proof of Work (POW) is being done, and where bitcoin has real-world value.\n
- **Testnet** is a network made up mostly of developers, but functions the same as mainnet. The key difference is that there is significatnly less POW on testnet.
- **Regtest** is once step simpler than testnet. This mode allows for more control of the way that the node runs.
### *In short*, the bitcoin used on this wallet are for learning purposes only and have no real world value.
