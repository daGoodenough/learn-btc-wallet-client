# Key Selection

*At the current state of the app, you can only select one key*

Whether you select one or multiple keys, this is like choosing your password.

You can think of an address (that's what you're creating right now) as a safety deposit box. The public key can be thought of as the name/location of that box, and the private key is how you actually unlock that box.

If an address is created using one key, then only that one key is required to spend the bitcoin locked to that address.

If an address is created mulitple keys or a special locking script, then certain conditions must be met in order to spend bitcoin locked to that address.

### Essentially keys are the password that allow you to spend bitcoin by signing transactions.
