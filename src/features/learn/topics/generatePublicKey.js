# Generating a Public Key
---
Public keys are generated based on the private key uysing elliptic curve multiplication.

The *same* public key will always be generated from a specific private key, but a private key can *never* be generated from a a public key.

Elliptic curve multiplication is a **1 way function**

### Share your public key, **never* share your private key.
